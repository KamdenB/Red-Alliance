### Assuming you have Linux or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) installed, you can install a webserver program like nginx or apache with your package manager.
### For the following command line snippet, we assume you are running Ubuntu and want to use the nginx webserver.
### 1. Install the nginx webserver.

    `sudo apt update`

    `sudo apt install nginx -y`

### 2. Start the nginx webserver.

    `service nginx status`

    `sudo service nginx start`

### 3. Open `localhost:80` in your web browser to see if nginx installed and run properly. You should see a webpage that thanks you for using nginx.

### 4. Copy the website files over to the /var/www/html/ folder.

    `cd Red-Alliance/`

    `sudo cp * /var/www/html/`

### 5. Reload the web page, you should see your index.html hosted.
